# Spotify-Clone
Live demo: https://mshamsheer-spotify.freewebhostmost.com/ <br><br>
# NOTE:<br>
<strong>I haven't added all the songs to the live demo due to limitations on the free hosting website, which provides a limited amount of storage space. Additionally, the CSS file may not be working correctly on the hosting site. However, please note that all the code is correct, and the application functions properly when tested using the Visual Studio Code live server.<strong><br><br>
